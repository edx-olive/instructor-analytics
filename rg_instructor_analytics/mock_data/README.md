This section is intended for emulation data sets for demo purposes.

At datasets directory, file names (without extensions) contains key for getting data, 
that is got from a course_key.

For correct work of 'Problems' mocking, should be used existed/appropriate problem ids 
for the course key.
For the key 'course-v1:rg+01+2019' appropriate course data is stored at 
`demo_courses/course.w8zTBp.tar.gz`.
